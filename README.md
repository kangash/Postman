Here you can find some examples of my solutions to API testing in Postman using automated tests in JavaScript.

---

### Task 1:
Send GET, POST requests. Write tests to check: 
- response status code 
- response body contains a valid string
- response contains a parameter 
- the value of the parameter in the response, the value is taken from the request
- array element values

The full description of the task (in Russian) can be found here:

### Solution:

- autotests in JavaScript
- parsing requests and responses 
- for and for...in JS loops
- output the parameter values to the console
- collection environment to simplify requests

Follow the link to find the collection and environment files that you can import into Postman:

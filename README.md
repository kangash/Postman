Here you can find some examples of my solutions to API testing in Postman using automated tests in JavaScript.

---

### Task 1
Write tests to check: 
- response status code 
- response body contains a valid string
- response contains a parameter 
- the value in the response is equal to the value from the request
- array element values

The full description of the task can be found here:

### Solution

I used to solve the task:

- autotests in JavaScript
- parsing request and response
- for and for...in JS loops
- output the parameter values to the console
- collection environment to simplify requests

Follow the link to see the solution. There you will find a collection and environment files to import into Postman:

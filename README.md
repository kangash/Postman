Here you can find some examples of my solutions to API testing in Postman using automated tests in JavaScript.

## Task 1
Write tests to check response status code, response body has the required parameter and the valid value, etc.

### Solution

I used to solve the task:

- autotests in JavaScript
- parsing request and response
- for and for...in JS loops
- output the parameter values to the console
- collection environment to simplify requests

Follow the link to see the solution. There you will find a collection and environment files to import into Postman:
